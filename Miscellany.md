We decided to choose the MIT License as it is the most commonly used license. We believe that for a program like this,
everyone should be able to modify or utilize it for their own use, as long as it credits us and furthers the future of Computer Science.
We also chose the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, as our code of conduct because it's widely utilized and respected in the open source community.
Additionally, it provides clear and concise guidelines for expected community behavior to ensure that we are fostering a diverse and inclusive environment.
